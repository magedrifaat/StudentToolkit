# StudentToolkit
This was my final project for CS50x 2017, It is a simple website composed of 5 tools each is a simple application of an API.
The index page lists the used APIs and technologies in the project and each page from the navigation bar has one of the tools.

This project was built with a simple jquery front-end and a python back-end using Flask microframework and jinja template engine for python.
It is composed of a spell-checker, a grammar proofreading tool, a simple dictioanry, an equation solving tool, and a simple function graphing tool.
